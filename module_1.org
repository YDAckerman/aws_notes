* client-server model
  - client makes request to server (this could be anything, given
    context & permissions)
  - server on aws is EC2 (amazon elastic compute cloud)
    - validates the request is legitimate and provides response.

* pay for what you need. 


* Cloud Computing:
  - on-demand delivery of it resources with pay-as-you-go pricing
  - undifferentiated heavy-lifting of IT - don't have to setup MYSQL
    and such. AWS does that for you.


* Cloud-based deployment
  - run all operations in the cloud
  - For example, a company might create an application consisting of
    virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are
    fully based in the cloud.

* On-Premise Deployment (private cloud deployment)
  - run all operations on dedicated in-house equipment.
  - much like legacy IT, but helps to increase resource utilization

* Hybrid Deployment
  - run operations on a combination of cloud and in-house equipment
  - some cloud based resources are connected to on-premise
    infrastructure. maybe for maintainance purposes, etc.

* Benefits of cloud computing:
  - trade upfront costs for variable cost.
  - less focus on infrastructure maintainance more focus on
    applications and products.
  - Scales (no need to know before)
  - new resources available immediately when needed
